# Meteorological remote sensing standardised repository

## What is this repository?

This code allows a user to create a standardised database of a range of satellite weather  data.  It is designed specifically for Dr Helen Greatrex and her work/partners.  

For general users (for now), you might find the IRI Data library more user friendly - https://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/

To read instructions, see data requirements and check out some worked examples - see the wiki:

Note, this packages contains two years of test data (one year for ARC2 and one for RFE2).  The final release will include code to download the full archive of many more projects
