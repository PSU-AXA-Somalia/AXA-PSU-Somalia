# Meteorological remote sensing standardised repository

## What is this repository?

This code allows a user to create a standardised database of a range of meteorological data.  It is specifically for Dr Helen Greatrex and her work/partners.  For general users, you might find the IRI Data library more user friendly - https://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/
